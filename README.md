# AngularJS.org Home Page

The angularjs.org site is not designed to be used by third parties.
It is only kept here as part of our own deployment processes.

If you want to have a go at hosting it yourself you can try running

    yarn run build

This will build the website in the `build` folder, which you can then serve with something like:

    yarn start

and browse to http://localhost:8080

**Note: we do not provide support for doing this.**

The site relies upon accessing numerous additional resources from all over the web.

Hint: to access the AngularJS docs application rather than this site, which is only the homepage,
clone the main project and build the docs yourself.
